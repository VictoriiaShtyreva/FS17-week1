## Viktoriia Shtyreva

Frontend Developer | Full Stack Developer | Helsinki, Finland

I'm a highly motivated and detail-oriented frontend developer with a passion for creating responsive websites. I'm proficient in a wide range of web development tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, and TypeScript. I'm also experienced in working with RESTful services/APIs, UI/UX principles, and version control systems.

I'm currently working on expanding my skills to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. I'm a team player and I thrive in collaborative environments. I'm also always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

## Hobbies

- **Dog:** I love spending time with my dog. I love taking her for walks, playing with her in the park, and just cuddling up with her on the couch.
- **Crocheting:** I find crocheting to be a very relaxing and rewarding hobby. I love creating beautiful and unique pieces of crocheted work. I also enjoy sharing my crocheting skills with others and teaching them how to crochet.
- **K-pop dance:** I love dancing to K-pop music. It's a great way to get exercise, have fun, and express myself. I also enjoy watching K-pop performances and learning new dance moves.
